# cpnt
color printed messages from terminal

Possible ideas: 
* text color animation
* text manipulation (awk-like)
* text color formatting

This is supposed to be a simple commandline tool to colorize text and output (for pipeing)
It may possibly end up like lolcat, or some sort of text fade that the user can define
