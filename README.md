# cpnt
color printed formatting messages from terminal

Run:
make to compile, then ./bin/cpnt {optional-args} {color} {message...}

Possible ideas: 
* text color animation
* text manipulation (awk-like)
* text color formatting

This is supposed to be a simple commandline tool to colorize text and output (for pipeing)
It may possibly end up like lolcat, or some sort of text fade that the user can define.
