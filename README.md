# cpnt
color printed formatting messages from terminal

Run:
make to compile, then ./bin/cpnt [args] (color) (message...)

Possible ideas: 
* text color animation
* text manipulation (awk-like)
* text color formatting

This is supposed to be a simple commandline tool to colorize text and output (for pipeing)
It may possibly end up like lolcat, or some sort of text fade that the user can define.

#TODO:

1. create a less buggy code structure
2. add more colors
3. add more functions
4. make it so the user can use cpnt without color, instead of 'invalid color' (just to format a message)
