## cpnt (color printed terminal)
color printed formatting messages from terminal

#### Run:
make to compile, then (./bin/)cpnt [args] [color] (message...)

#### Possible ideas: 
* text color animation
* text manipulation (awk-like)
* text color formatting

This is supposed to be a simple commandline tool to colorize text and output (from other commands)
It may possibly end up like lolcat, or some sort of text fade that the user can define. My current plan is to remake it into something more of a text animator. Right now, it is just a concept.

#### TODO:
1. create a less buggy code structure
2. add more colors
3. add more functions
